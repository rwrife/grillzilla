# Grillzilla  

## Extenal gas grill temperature monitor

Had issues with the gas grill being left on overnight, wasting propane, so I came up with this little device that is a low powered ESP32 - MLX90614 powered sensor that will text you when it detects if the grill is still one. 

I provided two KiCad models, one that uses a Seed Studio (Xiao) module and an I2C breakout for the MLX that could be built by just about anyone and one that is a full PCB using an ESP32-C3 that will need to be manufactured.
